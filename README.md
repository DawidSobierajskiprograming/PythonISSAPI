# PythonISSAPI
 Python Code to make a API that asks user what datas they would like to know about the ISS and then returns them the data. 
 Its very small and short
 It isn't supposed to be complex its just me re learning how to work with Json and API in a very basic way.
 I decided to put all the actions on Tkintier so that i can practice using tkinter 
 So far I have:
  -Put a image on the main Tkinter Window
  -Added buttons on the Main Tkinter window:
    - Current altitde of the ISS
    - Current velocity of the ISS
    - Current latitude and longitude of the ISS
    - What country the ISS is above unless its above water in which case it says it is above water
  - Have 4 points of data being returned to the User like stated above
 Future additions that i have planed include
  - How to print results in the same window as the buttons
  - Map of the world with as small image of the ISS with a arrow pointg down on the map in corelation to the latitude and longitude of where it actualy is
    some way of doing this might include:
    - Having a image of the world
    - Make the values of Latidude and Longitude double so that it corrisponds from the bottom left corner of the image and goes out to the actual points on the world map image
    - put a image of the ISS and arrow ontop of the world image and put it corresponding to the doubled values of the Latitude and Longitude
